Here are 4 .csv files corresponding to the acetate measurements of each strain studied by Chen et al.: ACS1, cit2, mls1, and reference. The data were extracted using WebPlotDigitizer.

The .csv files are structured into 5 columns:

    1. Measurement time in hours
    2. Acetate concentration in g/L
    3. Absolute concentration error in g/L
    4. Acetate concentration in mMol/L
    5. Absolute concentration error in mMol/L
